## Store tuples in a query table backed by transactional memory

In this sample, a query table is used to update, read and delete tuples, so :

* Query table is key'ed by **name** field
* A tuple injected on the **UpdateStream** stream containing **name** & **value** will insert or update the **name** entry in the table with the new **value**
* A tuple injected on the **ReadStream** stream containing **name** will read the current value from the table
* A tuple injected on the **DeleteStream** stream containing **name** will delete the name from the table

The query table is configured with transactional memory :

A data distribution policy **static-data-distribution-policy** is set ( to be later defined in the application definition configuration file ) :

Finally, the tuples stored in the query table are partitioned by the **name** field :

## Design notes

Processing is always on the local node, hence :

* Routing to a remote node is not required
* Query scope is local ( ie not cluster wide )

## Running this sample from TIBCO StreamBase Studio&trade;

Use the **Run As -> EventFlow Fragment** menu option to run in TIBCO StreamBase Studio&trade;, and then enqueue tuples :

Note that here we are unit testing the business logic rather than high availability - in this sample we test high availability in
the application archive integration test cases.  The unit test cases can test high availability by loading an activating test versions 
of the application definition and node deployment configuration files.

## Building this sample from the command line and running the unit test cases

Use the [maven](https://maven.apache.org) as **mvn install** to build from the command line or Continuous Integration system :
